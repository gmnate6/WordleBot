# WordleBot
WordleBot is a Python-based application that automatically solves the game of Wordle. It uses a Custom Tkinter UI for a user-friendly interface and a specialized Wordle module for the game logic.

## Features
- Wordle Solver: The bot solves any given Wordle puzzle based on the feedback from the game (correct, wrong, or mispositioned letters).
- Custom UI: Built using Custom Tkinter, the application provides a simple and interactive interface to play the game.
- Efficient Algorithm: The solver uses a dictionary of possible words and filters out incorrect guesses based on the clues provided during each round of the game.
- Full Game Logic: The WordleBot holds all the necessary game logic, including feedback interpretation and guess generation.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x: Core language for implementation.
- Tkinter: For building the graphical user interface (GUI).
- Custom Wordle Module: Handles the logic of solving Wordle puzzles.
